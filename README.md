# Mini-Vision-Agent-
A simple but powerful Python-based AI agent that uses YOLOv8 for real-time object detection and provides audio feedback using text-to-speech (TTS). Designed as part of my Data Science learning journey, this project demonstrates how computer vision can assist in real-world accessibility use cases like blind assistance.
